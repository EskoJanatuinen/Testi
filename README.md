# Ostoslista (shopping list)

I made this app to make my grocery shopping easier! It arranges the shopping list in the order of the store divisions in Citymarket Kolmisoppi (Kuopio). This saves me at least 30 minutes each time I'm grocery shopping. :)

This is a Firebase app (cloud-hosted, NoSQL database). Node.js/Express was used for the server functionalities.

This was my first project with Javascript and Firebase so the code is not pretty. But it works!

ps. if someone knows how to reference public folder from functions folder, please let me know! This seems to be prohibited with Firebase. I had to make a duplicate of my JSON-file containing the product data as I needed to access it both from index.html (in public) and from index.js (in functions).
